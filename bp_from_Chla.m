%Inputs: Chla, lambda
%   Chla (nx1 Double): Vector containing chlorophyll-a concentrations [mg

%
%   lambda (mx1 Double): Vector containing light wavelengths [nm] at which
%   output values of bp are calculated. Note that if n~=m, then either m or
%   n must be 1. Note: light wavelength is in vacuum
%
%Outputs: bp
%   bp (max(n,m)x1 Double): Particulate scattering coefficient [m-1] at
%   input light wavelengths.
